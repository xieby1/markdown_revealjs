pandoc-quotes.lua - Replace plain quotation marks with typographic ones
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc\f[R] \f[B]--lua-filter\f[R] \f[I]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] is a filter for \f[B]pandoc\f[R] that
replaces non-typographic quotation marks with typographic ones for
languages other than American English.
.PP
You can define which typographic quotation marks to replace plain ones
with by setting either a document\[aq]s \f[I]quot-marks\f[R],
\f[I]quot-lang\f[R], or \f[I]lang\f[R] metadata field.
If none of these is set, \f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] does nothing.
.PP
You can add your own mapping of a language to quotation marks or
override the default ones by setting \f[I]quot-marks-by-lang\f[R].
.SS quot-marks
.PP
A list of four strings, where the first item lists the primary left
quotation mark, the second the primary right quotation mark, the third
the secondary left quotation mark, and the fourth the secondary right
quotation mark.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
quot-marks:
    - \[aq]\[aq]
    - \[aq]\[aq]
    - \[aq]
    - \[aq]
\&...
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You always have to set all four.
.PP
If each quotation mark consists of one character only, you can write the
whole list as a simple string.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
quot-marks: \[dq]\[dq]\[aq]\[aq]
\&...
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If \f[I]quot-marks\f[R] is set, the other fields are ignored.
.SS quot-lang
.PP
An RFC 5646-like code for the language the quotation marks of which
shall be used (e.g., \[dq]pt-BR\[dq], \[dq]es\[dq]).
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
quot-lang: de-AT
\&...
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Only the language and the country tags of RFC 5646 are
supported.
For example, \[dq]it-CH\[dq] (i.e., Italian as spoken in Switzerland) is
fine, but \[dq]it-756\[dq] (also Italian as spoken in Switzerland) will
return the quotation marks for \[dq]it\[dq] (i.e., Italian as spoken in
general).
.PP
If \f[I]quot-marks\f[R] is set, \f[I]quot-lang\f[R] is ignored.
.SS lang
.PP
The format of \f[I]lang\f[R] is the same as for \f[I]quot-lang\f[R].
If \f[I]quot-marks\f[R] or \f[I]quot-lang\f[R] is set, \f[I]lang\f[R] is
ignored.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
lang: de-AT
\&...
\f[R]
.fi
.SH ADDING LANGUAGES
.PP
You can add quotation marks for unsupported languages, or override the
defaults, by setting the metadata field \f[I]quot-marks-by-lang\f[R] to
a maping of RFC 5646-like language codes (e.g., \[dq]pt-BR\[dq],
\[dq]es\[dq]) to lists of quotation marks, which are given in the same
format as for the \f[I]quot-marks\f[R] metadata field.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
quot-marks-by-lang:
    abc-XYZ: \[dq]\[dq]\[aq]\[aq]
lang: abc-XYZ
\&...
\f[R]
.fi
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc\f[R] represents documents as abstract syntax trees
internally, and quotations are nodes in that tree.
However, \f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] replaces those nodes with their
content, adding proper quotation marks.
That is, \f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] pushes quotations from the syntax
of a document\[aq]s representation into its semantics.
That being so, you should \f[I]not\f[R] use \f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R]
with output formats that represent quotes syntactically (e.g., HTML,
LaTeX, ConTexT).
Moroever, filters running after \f[B]pandoc-quotes\f[R] won\[aq]t
recognise quotes.
So, it should be the last or one of the last filters you apply.
.PP
Support for quotation marks of different languages is certainly
incomplete and likely erroneous.
See <https://github.com/odkr/pandoc-quotes.lua> if you\[aq]d like to
help with this.
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] is Unicode-agnostic.
